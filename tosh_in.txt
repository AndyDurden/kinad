# For systems that have reactions other than intramolecular 1:1 stoiciometry, you'll have to use this input format
# Hashes can be used to comment out lines.
# First line gives a name to each structure, separated by spaces
ox abicnr abic acic bbic bcic ab2bcic pyra pyrb
# Second line must be empty

# Next (non-empty) line starts the first reaction. All reactions should be separated by a blank new line.
# First line of a reaction lists reactant names
ox
# 2nd: lists reactant stoic. coefficients in the same order as they're listed above
1
# 3rd: lists product names
abicnr
# 4th: lists product stoic. coefficients in the same order as they're listed above
1
# 5th: lists rate law reactant exponents
1
# 6th: is the Free Energy Activation Barrier of the reaction in kcal/mol
18.03032039993
# Next line should be empty, this ends the description of a reaction.
