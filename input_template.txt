# For systems that have reactions other than intramolecular 1:1 stoiciometry, you'll have to use this input format
# Hashes can be used to comment out lines.
# First line gives a name to each structure, separated by spaces
reactant int1 int2 int3 product
# Second line must be empty

# Next (non-empty) line starts the first reaction. All reactions should be separated by a blank new line.
# First line of a reaction lists reactant names
reactant
# 2nd: lists reactant stoic. coefficients in the same order as they're listed above

# 4th: lists product stoic. coefficients in the same order as they're listed above
1 2
# 5th: lists rate law reactant exponents
